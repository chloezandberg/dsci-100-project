    "- This classifictation model is intended to provide insight into how study time, free time, and absences affect student performance. We aim to measure and comprehend the predictive potential of these variables for grade categories(e.g.,A+,A,B,F,etc.). For example, more study time mat be linked to better grades; free time may be linked to both academic success and general well-being; and frequent absenteeism may have negative impacts on grades. We anticipate identifying which lifestyle and study habits are most predictive of academic success. This includes how study time affects grades, how crucial it is to manage free time for academic productivity, and how frequent absences harm students's academic performance.\n",
    "- Our project's findings could influence curriculum development and educational policy in addition to inspiring the creation of focused intervention initiatives. Through an awareness of the connections between study time, free time, absenteeism, and academic performance, educators and politicians may create curriculum and policies that support productive study habits, stimulate leisure activities, and stress the value of consistent attendance. With their help, schools would be able to provide at-risk students with specialized mental health services, attendance improvement plans, and tutoring on an individual basis. In the end, these adjustments might enhance learning results, foster student growth, and get students ready for further education and employment\n",
    "- Future Questions: How could schools and educational institutions measure the long-term success of personalized intervention strategies that are based on student's specific patterns in study time, free time, and attendance? How might the interaction between study habits, leisure time, and attendance during formative educational years influence cognitive development and decision-making skills into adulthood? \n",
