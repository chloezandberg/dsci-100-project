    "This group will be examining factors influencing student performance in Portuguese secondary students to attempt to answer the question of which factor is most influential in promoting good grades. We will be approaching this problem using classification techniques in R. The student achievement data was collected from 2 Portuguese secondary schools and assessed performance in mathematics. The data includes the target variable (student grades during periods 1, 2, and 3) in addition to 30 predictor variables. For the purposes of this project, we have chosen 3 variables with numerical values to be able to determine the answer to our question. The 3 variables are hours of free time, hours of study time, and number of school absences. Moreover, the data originally comes in an excel sheet format which will need to be considered when reading the data set into R. The data can be accessed through the link below Data set: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance Data set source: UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository"
